# Energy Analysis Dashboard

### 1. Project Title  
‚ö° **Energy Flow Dashboard: Renewable vs Non-Renewable Insights**  
An interactive analytical dashboard built to explore and compare renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, costs, and emissions across cities, seasons, and time.

### 2. Purpose 
The Energy Flow Dashboard is a Power BI project that visualizes energy usage patterns‚Äîbreaking down renewable vs non-renewable shares, cost per kWh, and emission impact‚Äîto surface trends and support informed sustainability and efficiency thinking.

### 3. Tech Stack  
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:  
‚Ä¢ üìä **Power BI Desktop** ‚Äì Primary visualization and report development platform.  
‚Ä¢ üìÇ **Power Query** ‚Äì Data ingestion, cleansing, and transformation.  
‚Ä¢ üß† **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** ‚Äì Calculated measures, YOY comparisons, dynamic KPIs, and conditional logic.  
‚Ä¢ üìù **Data Modeling** ‚Äì Relationships between cities, time periods, and energy source tables for cross-filtering and aggregation.  
‚Ä¢ üìÅ **File Format** ‚Äì .pbix for development; .png/.jpg for dashboard previews.

### 4. Data Source  
‚Ä¢ **eGRID (EPA)**, 
‚Ä¢ **SEDS (EIA)**, 
‚Ä¢ **City & County Energy Profiles**, 
‚Ä¢ **Chicago/New York Reports**  
Data includes city-level electricity consumption (kWh), fuel mix and emission factors, and energy

### 5. Features / Highlights  
- **Business Problem**  
Energy planners and analysts need a clear way to understand how renewable and non-renewable sources contribute to total consumption, what their cost trade-offs are, and how usage shifts over time and location. Raw figures alone obscure seasonal spikes, regional divergence, and sustainability implications.

- **Goal of the Dashboard**  
To provide an intuitive visual tool that:  
  ‚Ä¢ Tracks renewable vs non-renewable energy share.  
  ‚Ä¢ Highlights cost differentials and emission impacts.  
  ‚Ä¢ Reveals temporal (monthly/seasonal) and geographic (city-level) patterns.  
  ‚Ä¢ Surfaces year-over-year changes to identify improving or deteriorating trends.

- **Walkthrough of Key Visuals**  
  - **Top-left KPIs**: Total renewable and non-renewable energy (kWh), aggregate consumption, emission factor (kg CO‚ÇÇ/kWh), and cost per kWh.  
  - **Location-wise YOY Comparison**: Bar chart showing non-renewable energy by city with year-over-year percentage change (e.g., growth or reduction in usage).  
  - **Monthly Trend Line**: Tracks non-renewable energy consumption over months to expose peaks and troughs.  
  - **Seasonal Breakdown**: Horizontal bars showing energy use by season (e.g., highest in Summer).  
  - **Energy Share Cards**: Percentage split of renewable vs non-renewable.  
  - **Cost Insight Banner**: Calls out cost per kWh differences and relative premium of renewables (e.g., renewable 38.6% higher cost).  

- **Business Impact & Insights**  
  ‚Ä¢ **Cost Awareness**: Identifies that renewables, while dominant in share, incur higher unit cost‚Äîguiding prioritization or subsidy modeling.  
  ‚Ä¢ **Sustainability Monitoring**: Tracks renewable adoption over time to support green targets.  
  ‚Ä¢ **Regional Strategy**: Highlights cities with increasing non-renewable dependence or successful reductions.  
  ‚Ä¢ **Temporal Planning**: Seasonal and monthly patterns inform demand management and capacity planning.
